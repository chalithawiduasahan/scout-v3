# Linkup search tools (replaces Tavily)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Linkup has no pre-built Strands tool like strands_tools.tavily did, so this
# is a small custom wrapper. Two separate tools are exposed with DIFFERENT
# fixed depths, rather than one tool where the model picks the depth itself -
# this guarantees discovery always uses the cheap/fast "standard" depth and
# research always uses the more expensive/thorough "deep" depth, instead of
# leaving that (and its cost impact) up to the model's judgement per call.
#
# NOTE ON COST: per Linkup's pricing, standard search runs ~$0.005-$0.055 per
# call, while deep search runs ~$0.25-$2.50 per call - roughly 50-100x more
# expensive. Deep is only used in research_agent below (once per selected
# business), not in discovery, to keep that cost bounded.

#   use disk instead of shared memory.
# --no-sandbox: Chromium's normal sandboxing needs OS permissions that hosted
#   containers usually don't grant, so it must be disabled to launch at all.
# --disable-gpu: no GPU is available in this hosted environment anyway, and
#   this avoids Chromium spending memory/time trying to set one up.
#
# NOTE: --single-process and --no-zygote were tried here to save more RAM,
# but --single-process merges Chromium's browser and renderer into one OS
# process, which is explicitly unsupported/unstable in headless container
# environments - it caused random "Target page, context or browser has been
# closed" crashes mid-run. Removed for reliability; the single-shared-browser
# approach below (one browser reused across all 4 screenshots, guaranteed
# closed via try/finally) is the safe way to cut memory usage instead.

contact email if you actually found it in the search results - never invent one.

Keep the email SHORT, warm, and natural (under 100 words total).

Structure:
1. Short, friendly opening referencing their business.
2. Mention that manual customer follow-ups and lead logging often take up hours of time.
3. State that you built a quick functional automation prototype for them (referencing the 4 attached screenshots: Tally Contact Form, Airtable CRM Record, Auto-reply Email, and Slack Team Notification).
4. Direct soft CTA: Ask if they have 5 minutes for a quick demo call or want to automate other manual tasks.

RULES:
- Do NOT use markdown formatting like asterisks (**bold** or *italic*). Output pure plain text only.
- Keep sentences short and direct.
- End the sign-off strictly with:
